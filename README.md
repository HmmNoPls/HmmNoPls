- ✏️ Participated in [r/place](<https://www.reddit.com/r/place/>) 2022 & 2023
    - 2022: Placed a few pixels then gave up
    - 2023:
        - First pixels placed after 1st expansion (On the Track of the [Metro Train line](https://2023.place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/#331/52/1/-379/0.721))
        - Mostly fixing random pixels, primarily in the bottom left [Windows Taskbar](https://2023.place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/#1352/205) & top right [Tasklist](https://2023.place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/#4309/218)
        - Helped in Typing [F*** Spez](https://2023.place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/#1925/218) after Final expansion
        - Helped in fixing [Technoblade Art](https://2023.place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/#359/234), Top Left of [F*** Spez](https://2023.place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/#1925/218), [Ukraine Flag](https://2023.place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/#20/251) & [Perry The Platypus](https://2023.place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/#854/251) during Bot Attacks shortly before Greyout
        - Was at Greyout/Whiteout & Helped in Typing both the smaller F*** Spez (Was Abandoned) & the [main one](https://2023.place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/#3158/257)
        - Was fun while it lasted :)
